# iot-garden
(Code, wiki, project board and diagrams for an IOT-based automated garden.)

**Progress:**
* May - researching how to use the AWS IoT SDK to create a stack, learning what is required to securely register a device and send telemetry to the cloud. Good success creating a stack using SDK - i.e. thing, thing group, authentication with certificates, security policy, creation of certificates, securely storing certificats etc.  
* April - prototype device and sketch for ESP32, research into hosting on AWS IoT, exploring CDK for IoT stack creation, abandoned CDK approach as it has limitations that aren't present in the SDK or CLI. Hosting on AWS looks promising, but just not with CDK.
