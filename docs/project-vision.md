# Project Vision

## Why: 

Many of us enjoy gardening but it's not our full-time job. Part-time gardners often juggle competing priorities; family, travel, school and jobs. Wouldn't it be amazing if the garden was automated and we could check in on it or make adjustments any time, anywhere we are? This would make it possible to enjoy our garden while on vacation, for example, dote on it remotely or just check on the garden for our own piece of mind. Happy plants make us happy gardners. 

## How:

The Internet of Things (or IoT) makes this vision possible. IoT refers to a network of connected devices able to collect and exchange data coming from embedded sensors. Any stand-alone internet-connected device that can be monitored and/or controlled remotely is considered an IoT device. Imagine an IoT device that uses data from a soil moisture scensor to determine when your plants are thirsty and how much water to give them.

## What: 

Here at IoT Garden, playing with sensors and creating IoT devices is a fun and rewarding activity, but not everyone shares this interest. Maybe you just want to enjoy your garden and completely ok with using technology to manage it. This is why we offer turn-key solutions without all the complexity of creating your own IoT devices. 

All of our solutions are remotely accessible using a web browser or smart phone. This allows you to make adjustments and monitor sensor data.

**Our pilot products are:**

* Moisture management device that maintains a specified moisture range. Typical automatic waterers just turn the water on and off at a given schedule. This is fine for your lawn, but in the garden this often results in over-watering or under-watering. A more precise approach for the garden is to specify the soil moisture range to maintain. Your flowers, for example, are happy with a soil moisture level of 20% to 40%, whereas your vegitables are happy with a range between 40% and 80%. The IoT watering device monitors soil moisture levels and turns the water on at the lower limit and turns the water off at the upper limit.

* Temperature management device that maintains a temperature range for your covered bed or greenhouse. Your orchids, for example, are happy with a daytime temperature of 80-90F and 65-70F at night. The IoT temperature management device will open and close a vent to keep the greenhouse in that temperature range.
