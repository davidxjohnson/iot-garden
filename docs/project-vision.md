# Project Vision

## Why: 

Many of us enjoy gardening but it's not our full-time job. Part-time gardeners often juggle competing priorities such as family, travel, school, and jobs. Wouldn't it be amazing if the garden was automated and we could check in on it or make adjustments any time, from anywhere? We can stop worrying about the garden while traveling or check on it for our own piece of mind. Happy plants make us happy gardeners.

## How:

Imagine a internet connected smart device that uses data from a soil moisture sensor to determine when your plants are thirsty and how much water to give them. Compare this to an ordinary sprinkler timer (you might get from a home improvement store) that will either overwater or underwater your plants. Because the smart device is internet connected, data coming from the device sensors can be automatically monitored and alerts sent when a problem arises. You can also make adjustments from anywhere using your smart phone.

## What: 

Here at IoT Garden, designing smart devices with embedded environmental sensors is a rewarding pursuit, but not everyone shares this interest. Maybe you just want to enjoy your garden and are completely ok with using technology to manage it. This is why we offer affordable turn-key solutions without all the complexity of creating your own connected solution. 
All our solutions are secure and remotely accessible using a web browser or smart phone. This puts you in charge of fine-tuning the device parameters.

**Our pilot products are:**

* A moisture management device that maintains a specified moisture range. Typical automatic waterers just turn the water on and off at a given schedule. This is fine for your lawn, but in the garden, this often results in over-watering or under-watering. A smarter approach is to specify the soil moisture range. Your flowers, for example, are happy with a soil moisture level of 40% to 60%, whereas your vegetables are happy with a range between 40% and 80%. Once you enter these parameters, let the smart device do the work.

* A temperature management device that maintains a temperature range for your covered bed or greenhouse. Perhaps your orchids are happy with a daytime temperature of 80-95F and 65-80F at night. The smart device will open and close a vent to keep the greenhouse in that temperature range.
